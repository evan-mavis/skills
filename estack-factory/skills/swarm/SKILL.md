# Swarm

Only the root Factory chat dispatches this skill's subagents. If invoked inside a droid, return the scoped delegation requests to the parent. Preserve independent review and report pending proof until the parent collects results.

Fan out N parallel Factory workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, bounded by this session's available concurrency.
4. Use a custom droid with `model: inherit` and omit Task `complexity` to inherit the parent model and reasoning. Task does not accept arbitrary model or reasoning fields. If the user requests another model, verify its availability and the selected droid or configured complexity tier before dispatch. Report unavailable selections and any routing that changes the effective model. For a user-requested model race, name each available arm's model up front and report any missing arm.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers concurrently with the Factory `Task` tool. Subagents share the current host; give each writer an isolated worktree and explicit workspace path. Do not assume an `environment` parameter creates a cloud VM. Keep machine-local verification on a runtime that actually exposes the required tools.

When a worker must start from a non-default branch, prepare an isolated worktree at that exact ref and pass its path in the brief.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
